## 🛠️ Getting Started
	1.	Fork this repository.
	2.	Clone your fork:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apppath.git
cd apppath


	3.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	4.	Start Expo development server:

npm run start

## 🧠 Contribution Guidelines
	•	🌱 Beginners and intermediate developers are welcome.
	•	🧩 New app proposals must be submitted via issues/.
	•	💬 Communicate via Discord or GitHub discussions.
	•	🔍 Follow ESLint + Prettier formatting.
	•	📝 Use /apps/<project-name> for each mobile project.
	•	📲 Expo + Firebase integration must be properly documented in each project.

## ☁️ Deployment (Full-Stack on Expo + Firebase)
	•	Apps can be built and published directly via Expo.
	•	Firebase handles authentication, database, storage, and backend functions.
	•	No separate backend server is required — all logic runs serverless.
	•	Optional: Publish to Google Play Store and Apple App Store via Expo’s build service.

## 📈 Roadmap
	•	Add reusable UI components library
	•	Integrate push notifications
	•	Enable offline-first data sync
	•	Launch public contributor leaderboard for apps
	•	Build community-driven showcase of mobile projects
